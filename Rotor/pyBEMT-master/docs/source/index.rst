Introduction
------------

pyBEMT is an implementation of the Blade Element Momentum Theory in Python.
The model can be used to estimate the thrust generated by a propeller or 
the power generated by a turbine.

Notable features:

- A small and unified implementation for both propellers and turbines
- A model for coaxial rotors
- Optimization of rotor parameters

Installation
------------

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- sphinx (for documentation)

These can be installed using the provided ``requirements.txt``,
